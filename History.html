		<h3>Axumite Kingdom</h3>
		<img src="axumitekingdom.jpg" alt="Axumite Kingdom" width="300" height="300">
		<p>The Axumite Kingdom (circa 100 AD to 940 AD) was one of the most powerful ancient civilizations in 
		Africa, centered in what is now northern Ethiopia, including Tigray. At its height, Axum was a dominant trading 
		empire, connecting the Roman Empire, India, and Arabia via extensive trade routes. Renowned for its monumental
		obelisks, such as the stelae at Axum, the kingdom was also a major center for early Christianity, with King Ezana 
		adopting the religion in the 4th century. The Axumite Kingdom is credited with establishing a written script called 
		Ge'ez and for constructing impressive architectural and religious sites, solidifying its place as a crucial center of 
		culture and influence in ancient Africa before its decline in the 10th century.</p>

		<h3>Modern History and Current Conflict (1991 - Present)</h3>
		<p>After the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, Ethiopia transitioned into a federal republic, with the Tigray 
		People's Liberation Front (TPLF) playing a crucial role in forming the new government under the Ethiopian 
		People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The TPLF held substantial influence in the federal 
		government for nearly three decades, but growing tensions between the central government and the Tigray 
		region emerged as a result of political disputes, perceived marginalization, and centralization efforts by Prime 
		Minister Abiy Ahmed, who came to power in 2018. In November 2020, after years of mounting friction, the 
		conflict between the Ethiopian federal forces and the TPLF escalated into a full-scale war, with Ethiopian and 
		allied Eritrean troops launching military operations in Tigray. This war led to a humanitarian catastrophe, with 
		widespread reports of atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, ethnic cleansing, and starvation, often 
		described as the Tigray Genocide. The conflict has displaced millions and caused immense suffering. While a 
		ceasefire was declared in 2022, the region is still grappling with severe challenges in rebuilding infrastructure, 
		restoring services, and addressing the profound trauma caused by the conflict.
